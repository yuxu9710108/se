Just a note about the mg_invf_dump utility.

When writing mgmerge I found it useful to be able to dump
out small inverted files in ascii format using mg_invf_dump
with each actual term displayed as well.
So I modified it adding a "-t" option that causes each term to be
printed in quotes, provided the binary option isn't set.

The changed source and man pages are in the tar file of
changed/added mg code.
