In the Renaissance which brought together all human activities, art meant 
science, art meant truth to life:   Leonardo was a great figure because he 
embodied the epic endeavour of Italian art to conquer universal values:  he 
who combined within himself the fluctuating sensitivity of the artist and 
the deep wisdom of the scientist, he, the poet and the master.   A. Venturi, 
L'arte di Leonardo, in the 'Enciclopedia Italiana", xx, 1934.
